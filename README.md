Is an idea I've been thinking about for a long time. This web app is a teaser for the mobile version that was created to focus on my skills with Flask and React.js


Scans a PSQL database for pantry items to aggregate recipe search data and optionally use mapping API to pathway for missing ingredients.

Redux was used to handle user session state on the frontend while flask simply handles routing.
```
const SET_SESSION = 'session/SET_SESSION';
const REMOVE_SESSION = 'session/REMOVE_SESSION';
const setSession = (user) => {
    return {
        type: SET_SESSION,
        user,
    };
};

export const login = (email, password) => async (dispatch) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            email,
            password
        })
    });
    const user = await response.json()
    dispatch(setSession(user));
    return user;
};
```

### Technical
It was recommended to stick to a BFS approach when sorting through pantry names, but then after more research and advisement from Stack OverFlow, I came to a point where I append the amount of names to an obj as a constant, with an O(n) outer loop. 

```
if (pantry) {
        for (let key in pantry) {
            if (pantry[key].userId == id) {
                pantryName.push(pantry[key].name)
                userPantries.push(pantry[key])
                pantryImages.push(pantry[key].image)

                if (pantryImages) {
                    // 'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/beef-brisket.png,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/sliced-carrot.png,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/parsnip.jpg,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/None,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/garlic.png,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/guinness.png,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/beef-broth.png,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/seasoning.png,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/light-brown-sugar.jpg,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/bay-leaves.jpg,https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_500x500/regular-mustard.jpg';
                    let str = pantryImages[0]
                    const regex = /,/g;
                    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        const seek = str.search(regex)
                        imgArr.push(str.slice(0, seek + 1))
                        str = str.slice(seek + 1)
                    }
                    for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++) {
                        imgArr[0] = imgArr[0].slice(1)

                    }
                    for (let i = 0; i < imgArr.length; i++) {
                        imgArr[i] = imgArr[i].slice(0, imgArr[i].length - 1)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
